# Multi-Disease Prediction System Using Continuous Health Data 

## Overview
This project aims to develop a robust machine learning system capable of detecting multiple diseases using continuous data from various datasets. The system is designed to facilitate user interaction through a web-based front end built with Streamlit, allowing users to input their health data and receive disease predictions.

## Datasets
The project utilizes three datasets:

1. **Diabetes Dataset (diabetes.csv)**
   - Features: 
     - `Pregnancies`
     - `Glucose`
     - `BloodPressure`
     - `SkinThickness`
     - `Insulin`
     - `BMI`
     - `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`
     - `Age`
     - `Outcome` (Target variable)
   - Sample Data:
     ```
     6,148,72,35,0,33.6,0.627,50,1
     1,85,66,29,0,26.6,0.351,31,0
     ```

     ```

## Steps Followed

1. **Data Gathering**
   - Collected the three datasets mentioned above, each focusing on different health conditions.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned and prepared the datasets for analysis, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables where necessary.

3. **Model Training**
   - Implemented machine learning models to train on the preprocessed datasets. The models were selected based on their suitability for classification tasks.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Assessed the performance of the models using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) to ensure they meet the required standards for disease prediction.

5. **Front-End Development**
   - Developed a Streamlit application that allows users to enter their data for all three diseases. The application provides a seamless experience for users to receive predictions based on their input.
